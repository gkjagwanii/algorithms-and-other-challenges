# Alogrithms and other challenges
Solutions to different coding problems.

## Goal
The primary goal here is to improve my problem solving and coding skills.
The solutions to these problems and challenges are implemented in Java.

## Challenge Sources
- Leetcode
- Hackerrank
- Cracking the Coding interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
- Frequently encountered algorithmic problems.

## Going Forward
I will continue to implement solutions to tougher challenges.
I will hope to use other languages like Python, Javascript and C++ in the future.
